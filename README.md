# Animation-Nutmeg_POTG
## Introduction
* This is a test repository I made to test out how AnimKit works in real world production tasks.
## Scene Iteration using iter++ and Playblast+ API
* This scene was iterated 32 times when I animated it. 
* Each iteration was saved with one maya file, and two playblasts in .mp4 format encoded using playblast+ API (One with 24 frame padding and one without).
* So there is a total of 32 maya files and 64 playblasts in the iteration folder.
* All the iteration saved in total only consumed 63MB of disk space.
